# ADPROC


Welcome to the ADPROC github repo.

Please follow this checklist if you're going to be developing the project:

	1. git pull/fetch/sync
	2. off you go.
	
When you're done, remember to git commit and hay ho lets go.


You may also want to create a .gitignore file in the directory of this project.

This file tells git to ignore certain file types.

On my mac I have the file with the following values

	icon
	.DS_Store

to ignore Mac OSX system files.

For Windows you might want something like:

	Thumbs.db
	
To ignore Windows thumbnail files
